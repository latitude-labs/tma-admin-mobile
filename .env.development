# 2FA Mock Mode (Development Only)
# ===================================
# Since the backend now bypasses 2FA in development, we disable mock mode
# Set this to 'true' if you need to test the 2FA UI flow
EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_2FA=false

# Note: The backend is configured to:
# - Skip 2FA requirement in development environments
# - Return full auth token and user data on login
# - This allows normal API usage without 2FA complications

# Auto-Login Credentials (Development Only)
# ==========================================
# These credentials will be automatically filled in the login form
# in development mode to reduce friction during testing
